# Challenge-2
Bootcamp Challenge 2: Portfolio

# Challenge  Requirements
## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

# Installation

To meet the above criteria I created a webpage using my knowledge of HTML and CSS for my portfolio. I created a hero section with a banner image and my photo. I created a nav section in the header with links to the corresponding section on my portfolio. I created a grid on my works section after referring to the following page on [how to create an image gallery](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-an-image-gallery-with-css-grid-e0f0fd666a5c/). Using the grid I was able to make my first application larger than the rest. I also linked the images on my grid to the corresponding pages of my work. Finally using media queries I was able to change styling in my css to make my portfolio more consumable on different viewports.
